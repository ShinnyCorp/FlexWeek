# context.md — FlexWeek

## Current State
- 2026-10-02. v0.18.0 is released as latest (PR 39 merged at c50f264; the package workflow attached
  all eight assets). Nothing a student sees changed in 0.18.0. roadmap.md was rewritten to the open
  items plus the 0.18.x series planned from the Grok audit of 0.17.2 (102 findings).
- Rust (`engine/`, contract `docs/engine/contract.md`, wrappers `docs/engine/adapters.md`): the
  planner and solver, slots, weeks, day, month, explain, restore, recovery codes, the store's SQL
  helpers and database connection, and the desktop's Qt-free logic (`desk`: calendar, custom looks
  with saving, naming and import, files, focus, history, pomodoro, remind, reuse, tokens, update,
  week model). Python calls it through the `flexweek_engine` module; the Python wrappers only
  encode, call and decode.
- Python: the FastAPI routes (about 40 SQL statements remain in the route bodies of `create_app`),
  password hashing's random salt, the clock, the environment and file reads (the engine core is
  pure), the pydantic checks, `backend/models.py`'s Spotify and due-date copies, the `CATEGORIES`
  table in `calendar.py`, `TYPE_PT` in `tokens.py`, `custom_look.readability`, all Qt drawing, and
  `scripts/rig/drive.py`.
- Tests: 389 Rust engine tests (engine, store and bindings; clippy and fmt clean). The Python gate on
  this branch after the twin deletion: 3722 passed in 7 min 38 s (`fwtest gate --workers 4`). 259
  Python tests were deleted because their Rust twin went red under a deliberate break; the
  differential tests (`backend/tests/test_engine_parity.py`, `desktop/tests/test_engine_desk_parity*.py`)
  stay until after the release. Before the deletion the gate on `engine/full-port` passed 4059 in
  454 s; the shadow runs over the HTTP tests found no difference in responses or rows.
- CI on PR 35 at b0b2040 was green: verify, rig, Linux and Windows builds, CodeQL and the engine
  mutation job (32 cases). The packaged app after the engine has had only those builds.
- Speed (`log.tsv`, pr35 review at 2e2f76a): placing the probe week 1.1 ms (0.17.2: 2.9 ms; with a
  busy second thread 1.0 ms against 8.0). Drawing a frame of the hours 10.2 ms median (0.17.2:
  9.1 ms; the limit is 16 ms).
- Known differences from the Python originals: integers past 64 bits and JSON only Python reads
  (NaN, lone surrogates) in stored rows; an assignment estimate past 2^63 raises `OverflowError` in
  the engine where Python returned a number (seen once under hypothesis); `build_month` returns a
  month where Python raised `TypeError` on a finished session with no start.
- Open, for 0.18.1 on Jonathan's word: `test_tests_ring_at_no_volume` leaves a Qt `Bell` for garbage
  collection (teardown error); the three adapter tests; one survivor in the `today.json` mutation
  baseline; the interface-test tidy (T4). `backend/tests/fixtures/engine_recorded_calls.json` can
  no longer be re-recorded from the deleted tests. Then: delete the differential tests, `desk_ref/`
  and `backend/tests/engine_ref/`.
- spec.md drift: its CI desk step says "the desk parity files and the wrapper modules' tests"; it now
  runs the parity files plus `test_tokens.py` and `test_update.py`.
- Open for 0.17.3 (design polish, from 0.17.2): Bento's now pill inside today's column; Mission's
  beside-block names crossed by the now line; Clay's Day card with no hours for about 100 ms while it
  slides in; 12-hour times cut at Large 810 in Clay's Day summary and Retro's deadlines; Bento's
  header "F 2" at Large 810; Mission's 00:00 label 6 px left of the canvas.

## Domain Model
SQLite: users → sessions, many dated weeks keyed (user_id, week_start), one preference row. Default
desktop mode uses a local per-user database; hosted mode uses the configured deployment. There is no
automatic synchronization between them. Only the engine opens the database; the format is unchanged
from 0.17.2, so earlier passwords, sessions and recovery codes still work.
Assignments are keyed (user_id, id) with a JSON body and revision. A flexible block with
`assignment_id` is a work session of that assignment. Routines are keyed (user_id, id) as named
templates of locked blocks. Restore points snapshot all of an account's weeks and assignments.
Recovery codes are hashed per user and shown only once. A format-3 export can copy weeks,
assignments, preferences and routines onto another account after a preview. Recorded `operation_id`
values make a retried write return the first result.

## Non-Obvious Decisions
- The engine core is pure: Python reads the clock, environment, files and randomness and passes
  them in. JSON text crosses the boundary (a 12-block week costs about 0.02 ms to encode and decode).
- `serde_json` has `preserve_order` on, and `engine/clippy.toml` forbids the removes that reorder
  keys, so stored JSON keeps Python's key order.
- Colour maths calls the C library's `cbrt`, `pow`, `atan2`, `sin` and `cos`, looked up at run time
  (`desk/cmath.rs`: `libm.so.6`, `ucrtbase.dll` on Windows), so results match Python's to the bit.
- Case folding uses a table generated from this interpreter (`engine/tools/generate_casefold.py`),
  not a crate.
- The engine crate builds at opt-level 2 in debug so the solver's 150 ms budget holds under load
  (Jonathan's choice).
- `desk_ref/` and `backend/tests/engine_ref/` stay until after 0.18.0 on purpose: the differential
  tests need them. The Python tests of Python-only code stay too (see Current State).
- A week's identity is its Monday. Blocks store a day index and derive their date. `weeks` pins the
  ISO shape before parsing, because `date.fromisoformat` also accepts "20260907" and "2026-W37-1".
- GET /api/week 422s a non-Monday rather than snapping it, so client and server cannot disagree about
  which week is open.
- The identical-blocks short-circuit runs before the revision check, as the pre-dated code did.
- The migration is guarded on the weeks table existing and runs in an explicit BEGIN IMMEDIATE.
  Registration seeds no weeks row; a missing row already means an empty week.
- A new flexible task in the week on screen may use today onward, since the solver does not know
  today's date. The dialog offers Fixed or Flexible only for a new item; editing keeps the kind.
- The desktop app bundles the backend and runs it in-process (owner's choice 2026-09-07). The
  loopback port is chosen by binding a socket before `create_app`, because the backend pins its CSRF
  origin check and TrustedHostMiddleware to one origin; uvicorn gets the bound socket and runs with
  `loop="asyncio"`, `http="h11"`.
- An invalid FLEXWEEK_*_ORIGIN is an error, not a fall back to local, so a typo cannot quietly open
  a different, empty database.
- `profile_root()` reads QStandardPaths AppDataLocation, so `main()` sets the application name first.
- Nuitka is called directly, since `pyside6-deploy` rewrites its spec with machine paths.
- `theme` is `system|slate|nocturne` (default `system`, owner decision 2026-09-10).
  `allow_system_theme()` rebuilds an older preferences table once, keeping stored slate/nocturne.
- The accent stays at least CIE76 distance 15 from every category colour; a test in
  `desktop/tests/test_look.py` holds it.
- Windows installers: the Inno `AppId` and the MSI `UpgradeCode` are fixed forever so upgrades find
  the installed copy. The .exe is per account, the .msi per machine. Inno Setup 7.1.0 is downloaded in
  CI with its SHA-256 checked; WiX is pinned to 6.0.2 because v7 blocks on an EULA. Windows ICU is
  required from Windows 10 1809 rather than copied out of System32.
- Linux leads with a tar.gz so the executable bit survives. The AppImage needs FUSE; without it use
  `--appimage-extract` then `squashfs-root/AppRun`, or the tarball.
- The smoke test decides a week was drawn by counting colours in a grab of the window
  (`PAINTED_MIN_COLORS`, 8 px grid): a blank window is one flat colour.
- The release workflow stops a Windows installer or smoke test that hangs after ten minutes.

## Session Handoff
- 2026-10-02, `docs/roadmap-0-18-x` (from `main` at c50f264): v0.18.0 published; roadmap.md rewritten
  (history removed, 0.18.x series added); this file's Current State updated. Not pushed. Next: Jonathan's
  go for 0.18.1 (plumbing lane first, then the re-check pass and mockup round 1), and his yes or no on
  reading an End of 00:00 as 24:00 (proposed for the time-entry lane).
